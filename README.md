## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the [SDF10] API Learning Reflection! Through this exercise, you will reflect on key concepts, practical experiences, and the tools you've encountered or used in API interactions.

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols for building software applications and acts as the middleman that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. 
It explains the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information and that developers should use when they want to interact with the software component such as libraries or different services.

Its significance in software development is that they allow developers to access functionality or data from other applications or services without having to build those functionalities from scratch. This makes it easier for developer to build more complex applications.

I use APIs everytime I log in on a website using â€œlog in  with google. The website uses Googleâ€™s authentication API to verify my ID, allowing me to access the websiteâ€™s services without creating a new account.



2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API? 

[Your answer goes here]

An interface is a shared boundary or set of rules across which two separate elements of a computer system exchange information and affect with each other.
An API is a set of protocols, routines, tools and rules that allow different software systems to communicate with each other and for building software and applications. 

In summary, while an interface defines how components within a software system should interact with each other, an API is a set of rules and guidelines that explains how different software systems or elements should communicate with each other.

3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

   Endpoints:An endpoint in API is a specific path where API-related functions can be accessed. This path is a URL that represents the API's various functionalities, allows clients to interact with it and defining the structure and operations possible.

   Methods: Methods define the actions or operations that clients can perform on the API's endpoints. 
They are important to the function and design of RESTful APIs Common methods include GET (retrieve data), POST (create or submit data), PUT (update data), and DELETE (delete data).

Data Formats:APIs define the formats in which clients should send requests and the formats in which the API responds. The data exchanged between clients and servers via APIs is structured in specific formats to ensure both sides can read and understand the data

Types of APIs

- Web APIs: Web APIs or web services, are interfaces that operate over the internet and allow applications to communicate with each other.

- Operating System APIs: are interfaces provided by operating systems that serve as a bridge between software applications and operating systems or the hardware to ask for and carry out basic operations inside an operating system, this allows applications to perform operations like reading/writing a file, interacting with peripheral devices, managing files, accessing hardware devices, and controlling processes and managing memory.

- Library and Framework APIs:These are sets of routines, protocols, and tools bundled together in software libraries or frameworks, providing predefined functions that developers can use to interact with their functionality to aid application development.

- Database APIs: are interfaces that allow applications to interact and communicate with databases, this allows  a way for applications to store ,modify or delete data, send queries to the database and retrieve data.

- Hardware APIs: interfaces that allow software applications to interact, access, retrieve and control data from hardware devices.

- RESTFUL: interface that two computer systems use to exchange information securely over the internet and to manipulate resources, and they often return data.


  My favourite APIs are hardware APIs because they allow developers to build strong, durable, efficient, multi-functional and more diverse applications that allow developers to channel all the capabilities of present-day hardware.





4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs? 

[Your answer goes here]

I have also used curl, a command-line tool for transferring data with URLs, to interact with APIs. 

5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?

[Your answer goes here]

I feel confident in my ability to navigate and use APIs using tools like curl and have a good understanding of how to use them to retrieve and manipulate data.

However, one area where I see a need for improvement is in using APIs.

I can improve on this by practicing regularly, using API libraries, learn from others through online courses and youtube, staying updated with current trends and developments.
